Notes for post Balisage 2014 paper version

- Change the paper title to the official one
- Consider *not* using <map> as root element in project example
- Update images to reflect the presentation's
- Use @scope rather than @use-latest as attribute name in link example
- Update link target URNs to reflect the presentations (in scope/not in scope)
- Include comments about not presenting the eXist collections directly in an editor


Note re significance:

Metadata is not always used (witness Sandvik/Cassis). If we were to implement ml, a check-in to a specific level would suffice (not solve).

Fixes:

- Only use one collection, but trigger on vmap rather than collection.
- Forks, on the other hand, might require an additional collection.
