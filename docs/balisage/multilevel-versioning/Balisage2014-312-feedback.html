      <h2>Comments from Reviewer</h2>
      <p>[I am a little worried that] the authors may be bombarded by a series of "this has already been done" from the audience.</p>
<h4>Potential Improvments</h4>
      <p>The abstract of the paper "Multilevel versions" presents a very interesting challenge (versioning on top of an exiting non-XML
         aware VCS). However the paper disappoints because it fails to:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>explain and discuss the problem,</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>show an appropriate solution,</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>discuss adequately the pros and cons of that solution.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
<p>I make the following suggestions:
<ul>      <li><p>The paper could use a better sorganization. The reader is dragged back and forth through different branches of the discussion without
         a clear path: it is hard to understand where the discussion is coming from and where it is going.
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>There is also some confusion with the terminology used. For example, I have never seen the term "version handled [content]", that
         I assume be identical in meaning to the more familiar "versioned [content]".
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>This paper does not demonstrate knowledge of the existing theory of versioning and of the current VCS tools. This is reflected on the very poor bibliography. Now knowing the past experiences is not a very big problem: having
         a "beginner's mind" can surely lead to interesting new discoveries and advancement of the art. [That said,] it looks like the author has some experience, and some scars, in the field of working with versioned documents. I suggest
         the author have a look at the relevant tools and bibliography so that their experiences can be described more effectively, addressing
         still open problems (the translation problem is still very open) or reframing old problems in terms of new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>[What it looks like to me is that] in this case, the author ended up rediscovering the gist of modern distributed version control
         system such as git or mercurial. For example, the three "branches" that the paper describes are, adopting the familiar git
         notation, the "repository copy", the "index/staged copy" and the "work area copy" of a document. Similarly, part of the version
         map is equivalent to the "index file" of git. Last, "use latest problem" is the problem behind "floating submodules" vs "fixed
         submodules". I suggest the author to have a look at all of these topics, maybe starting from a book such as ProGit (CC BY-NC-SA)
         and then proceeding to scholarly literature.
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>A special notion is needed for the fact that they author also addresses the issue of "translation" in VCS. Translations are
         just one case of the more general problem of dealing with the consistency of related-but-different files in VCS, another common
         case is having files with the same content but in different formats. Some early work on these matters can be read in the Akoma
         Ntoso URI scheme (or naming convention) [http://www.akomantoso.org/release-notes/akoma-ntoso-3.0-schema/naming-conventions-1].
         Akoma Ntoso is an XML vocabulary for legal documents. In places like the EU the same act is translated in various languages
         and there is a file of each of these translations. In additions these laws are changed every now and then, so there is a versioning
         system in place to refer to "Act 10" in whatever version it is currently, "Act 10" as it was in 2010 or "Act 10" as it would
         be if "Proposition 9" passes tomorrow. All that while dealing with multiple formats and multiple languages.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>A last remark about terminology: the author writes "implying a versioning logic well-known from software development". I admit
         am I not familiar with the versioning scheme shown by the author. The only schemes I know are
<ul>
<li>      <p>Even/odd: Major versions are for big releases, odd minor versions are development version, even minor versions are stable
         versions with fixes: 1.0 is stable, 1.1 is development, 1.2 is stable, 1.2.1 is development.
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>Major/Minor + suffix: Major versions are for big releases, minor versions are for stable releases with small fixes or minor
         features. The development releases have suffixes such as "a/b" (alpha/beta), "-rc" (release candidate), "-dev", etc.
      </p></li></ul></p>
</li>
</ul></p>      
<hr  />
      <h2>Comments from Reviewer</h2>
      <h4 class="RightForBalisageWhy">Is Balisage the appropriate forum? <i></i></h4>
      <p>The author exposes the limitations of conventional version control and proposes (and supports) additional necessary features
         for versioning of XML documents. This talk is essentially a feature spec for XML content management. But the treatment is thorough and well-supported. The
         author acknowledges that he does not have the programming skills to develop an implementation. The draft paper is well-thought and well-executed. Arguments are well-supported. I would love to see an implementation based
         on this. </p>
      <hr  />
      
      <h2>Comments from Reviewer</h2>
<ul>
<li>      <p>Just above Figure 6, the text refers to "this whitepaper's version", which makes it sound like this submission is a marketing piece reworked into a conference paper.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>The paper nneds to be tightened; it takes about twice as much space as necessary to make it's point</p></li></ul>
      <h4 class="Improvements">Potential Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>      <p>It's not clear if each micro-version is still saved, but the multiple levels just give essentially check points for any given
         document
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>When Stage 1 is saved back to Stable, are all the intermediate versions of stage 1 still kept? This is unclear. When you then
         check out from Stable to Stage 1 again, does this action wipe out the previous version history of each save on Stage 1? It's
         not clear.  
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>At one point, you state "In other words, every Save results in a new version". [That lost me], if that's the case, then what's the key point
         of this project?
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>Under Figure 4, you write "The structure and contents of the metadata element are beyond the scope of this paper". Can you
         clarify why they are beyond scope?
      </p></li>
<li>      <p>In several places you have concerns about using programming for extensions (e.g. first paragraph after "The Editor". I'm not
         sure why this is a problem.
      </p></li></ul>

      <h2>Comments from Reviewer</h2>
      <h4 class="Improvements">Potential Improvements</h4>
      <p>
         	Nice clear discussion of the problem in the section "The 'use latest' problem".
         
      </p>
<ul>
      <li><p>
         	Under "Save, Check In, Check Out" you write "Stable resources can be
         	checked out to Stage 1 to be edited, however, in which case they are
         	locked in Stable while awaiting a check-in from Stage 1."  I think
         	you are re-creating a problem known in conventional version
         	management systems since RCS: RCS allowed one to check out a file
         	with a lock, which prevented others from updating the document until
         	the same user either checked in a new version or explicitly released
         	the lock.  One of the reasons CVS doesn't follow this model is that
         	a survey of some sites using RCS showed that the large majority of
         	write locks were held by people who had left the organization and
         	were no longer available to clear the locks.  (Locking also didn't
         	prevent the lost-update problem in RCS, leading to the automatic
         	merging behavior of CVS and SVN.)  This is to some extent
         	(exclusively?) a social problem, not a technical one, but it's
         	significant.  If you introduce locking, you must also specify in the
         	design what happens when the lock is never cleared.
         
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         	I suspect that the sites surveyed were academic sites, not
         	commercial sites with well developed workflows.  But even in a well
         	developed workflow, the question will arise: what happens if the
         	lock is never released?
         
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         	It would be helpful to have a concrete example of the urn scheme in
         	the section "Version abstraction", just to help reassure the reader
         	that they understand your scheme.  (And there! you see? I didn't.
         	You said four positions for language and country, and I said 'well,
         	what about a hyphen?'  because 'en-GB' has five characters by my
         	count.  But I see that you aren't counting the invariant hyphen.)
         
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         	As you observe, the resource structure you define is a nice
         	recursive version structure.  Since you just said quite clearly that
         	you were only having two levels, this reader is now asking "does he
         	not notice that his design doesn't need recursion and indeed cannot
         	usefully exploit recursion?  Or is he setting things up for a more
         	complex multi-level design to come?"
         
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         	In note 8, for "lose track of which language and version that
         	contains the latest information" read either "lose track of the
         	language ... that contains the latest information" or "lose track of
         	which ... version contains ...".
         
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
         	The use of xml:lang in the document skeleton under 'Version mapping
         	with translations' is strictly speaking tag abuse, I think: xml:lang
         	describes the language of the content of the element (here: the
         	URNs), not the content of the thing(s) a hyperlink points at.  My
         	advice to you, as a language lawyer, is to rename the attribute
         	'language' or something like that.  Or flash a winning smile to
         	disarm the audience and say "Of course, this is tag abuse, but this
         	is how we do it."
